In fact, it is not quite clear what \"popularity\" means here - the number of weeks in a chart, or number of points obtained after a survey (for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "Acousticness is measured on a scale of 0.0 (not acoustic) to 1.0 (very acoustic). Songs with higher acousticness are more likely to use acoustic and non-electronic instruments. The second subplot shows that most songs / music pieces are not acoustic.\n",

    "Danceability quantifies how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements, like tempo, rhythm, and beat. Songs with higher danceability have stronger and more regular beats. Like acousticness, danceability is measured on a scale of 0.0 (low danceability) to 1.0 (high danceability). In terms of danceability, values in this feature have - more or less - normal distribution.\n",

Songs with higher energy are more intense, dynamic, and loud. The distribution on the fifth subplot shows that most of the music pieces are described with high energy.\n",

    "On the other hand, instrumentalness predicts whether a track contains vocals. Instrumentalness is measured on a scale of 0.0 (likely contains vocal content) to 1.0 (likely contains no vocal content). Songs with higher instrumentalness are less likely to have vocals. Distribution of values in terms of instrumentalness is quite skewed - most samples has value of 0 or around 0, which means the songs are characterized with vocal content.\n",

    "Liveness detects the presence of an audience in a song. Liveness is also measured on a scale of 0.0 (no audience) to 1.0 (audible audience). Songs with higher liveness are more likely to have been performed live. It seems the songs in our dataset are performed without audience - most liveness values are closer to 0.0 than to 1.0.\n",

    "The next feature is loudness - it measures the decibel level of a song. Decibels are relative to a reference value, so songs with lower loudness values are quieter relative to the reference value of 0. Taking this into account, value distribution in loudness shows that most music samples are quieter (their loudness is closer to 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Speechiness measures the presence of spoken words in a song. It is measured on a scale of 0.0 (low speechiness) to 1.0 (high speechiness). Songs with higher speechiness are mostly composed of spoken words, like poetry or a talk show. Distribution of speechiness is rather skewed on the right - most songs / pieces seem to have no or very small number of spoken words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tempo measures the beats per minute (bpm) of a song. Many popular songs range from 50 bpm to 200 bpm. Songs with higher tempo have a faster pace. Distribution of tempo values is very similar to the one of \"popularity\".\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, valence measures the positivity of a song. It is measured on a scale from 0.0 (low valence) to 1.0 (high valence). Songs with higher valence sound happier and more cheerful. Distribution of valence in out dataset is not normal - valence of most songs is somewhere between 0.2 and 0.7. Only a tiny number of songs are characterised with high valence.\n",
