# SC1015-Project-Song-Popularity

## About:

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Music from Spotify dataset. Using Music variables (Loudness, Valence, Danceability, Artist name and etc) to predict what genre the music belongs to. For detailed walkthrough, view the source code in this order: 

1: Data Extraction and Cleaning
2: Data Visualizing and Correlation

## Problem Statement:

Personalized music recommendation that suits individual preferences are becoming more and more in demand as music continues to be a current trend. Each individual has their own prefences of music. We as a group of data scientist would like to help everyone in enhancing their musical listening experience by predicting music categories using machine learning. To better the music recommendation algorithms, better knowledge of the characteristics of various genres is needed. Users can expand their musical interests from this, in addition to learning about new songs.

## Problem Definition:

* Are we able to predict the genre of a music based on audio features?.  
* Which Model would be the best solution to assist with our prediction?.
