## About:

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Music from Spotify dataset. Using Music variables (Loudness, Valence, Danceability, Artist name and etc) to predict what genre the music belongs to. For detailed walkthrough, view the source code in this order:

2: Data Visualizing and Correlation

## Problem Statement:

Personalized music recommendation that suits individual preferences are becoming more and more in demand as music continues to be a current trend. Each individual has their own prefences of music. We as a group of data scientists would like to help everyone in enhancing their musical listening experience by predicting music categories using machine learning. To better the music recommendation algorithms, better knowledge of the characteristics of various genres is needed. Users can expand their musical interests from this, in addition to learning about new songs.

This idea could be used in many ways. We could use this to classify songs with ambiguous genres, which could help listeners find songs of their liking. It could also allow users to generate playlists of songs which are similar to ones they already like, leading to an increase in enjoyment and happiness among users. 

## Problem Definition:

* Are we able to predict the genre of a music based on audio features?  
* Which Model would be the best solution to assist with our prediction?
* How accurate is our model in the prediction of song genre?

## Dataset Description :
We used a dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db#SpotifyFeatures.csv for this project. It shows the measure of different qualities (i.e. energy, valence, etc) in different songs. Below is the description of the columns in the dataset.

genre | The genre of the song |
--- | --- | --- |
 artist_name| The name of the artist who sang the song |
--- | --- | --- |
track_name | The name of the song|
--- | --- | --- |
 track_id| The Spotify identification number of the track|
--- | --- | --- |
popularity | The popularity of the song |
--- | --- | --- |
 acousticness | How acoustic a song is. A score of 1.0 means the song is most likely to be an acoustic one. |
--- | --- | --- |
danceability | How suited the song is for dancing. |
--- | --- | --- |
 energy | A perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy |
--- | --- | --- |
popularity | The popularity of the song |
--- | --- | --- |
 acousticness | How acoustic a song is. A score of 1.0 means the song is most likely to be an acoustic one |
--- | --- | --- |
instrumentalness | The amount of vocals in the song. The closer to 1.0, the more likely it is to be instrumental |
--- | --- | --- |
key | The key in which the song was written. |
--- | --- | --- |
liveness | If the song was recorded live or not |
--- | --- | --- |
loudness | The loudness of the song in decibels |
--- | --- | --- |
mode | Whether the song is in a Major or Minor scale |
--- | --- | --- |
speechiness | The presence of spoken words in the track |
--- | --- | --- |
tempo | The tempo of the song |
--- | --- | --- |
time_signature | The time signature of the track |
--- | --- | --- |
valence | the positiveness of the track. A high valence value denotes a positive mood for the song. |
--- | --- | --- |
